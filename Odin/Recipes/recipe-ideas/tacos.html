    <h2>About this Dish</h2>
    <p>We love Mexican cuisine for its simplicity, ease and flavour and no dish encapsulates this more than beef tacos. And while there are plenty of variations to classic tacos, we think this recipe for beef tacos is the easiest and quickest out there - all you need is 5 ingredients and 20 minutes. The secret is using Coles Mexico Chile Con Carne Seasoning for a bold, vibrant Mexican flavour all from one packet. While traditional authentic taco recipes may call for soft corn tortillas, we used crunchy hard shell tacos because we know kids love them. Top with refreshing iceberg lettuce and capsicum, and you have a delicious, fun and hands-on dinner for the whole family.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Place the taco shells on a large baking tray. Bake for 5 mins or until heated through.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, add the mince to a non-stick frying pan over high heat. Cook, stirring, for 5 mins or until the mince changes colour. Add the chile con carne seasoning and 3/4 cup (185ml) water. Cook, stirring, for 5 mins or until the mince mixture thickens.</li>
        <li>Divide the taco shells among serving plates. Fill taco shells with the mince mixture, lettuce and capsicum.</li>
